# Optimization in Data Science

This repository aims to show how several Machine Learning algorithms are actually optimization models such as Linear Programs or Mixed Integer Linear Programs, among other.

So, **why are not they often used in practice?**. This is the million dollar question. The answers is actually pretty easy. They are not used in practice because they may take a lot of computation time to get results since they look for the optimal answer. Instead, what it is embedded in the libraries such as sklearn or caret (others as well) are heuristics that approximate the solution in reasonable times.

However, the knowledge in optimization provide the Data Scientists a good background for further analysis.

In this, you can find three projects I have developed:

1. Clustering using K-medians,
2. Support vector machines, and
3. Data protection analysis (solved via Bender's decomposition).
